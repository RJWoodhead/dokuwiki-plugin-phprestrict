# phprestrict
Dokuwiki plugin to restrict php inclusion to pages by namespace or name.

Overrides the current PHP setting, which enables PHP on all pages.

Enable PHP by namespace ("fred:"), page ("fred:derf") and page-prefix ("fred:php*).
You can then use the ACL to determine what users have the ability to edit PHP pages.

You can also disable "view source" on PHP pages (recommended).

PHP is also disabled on old revision pages.
